Sample project to showcase the implementation of Simple Application onCreate Post
// TODO: Link to blog here!

## Branches
- **primitive** to demonstrate bad practice, very primitive way of doing these kind of application onCreate pollution.
- **mid-way** to demonstrate how basic dagger implementation can clean up the application's onCreate already.
- **master** to demonstrate how the proposed conceptual approach cleans up the application's onCreate.
