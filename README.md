# SimpleAppOnCreate
Sample project to showcase the implementation of “How Big Is Your ‘Application’?” 

https://tech.xing.com/how-big-is-your-application-4c89377c51d

## Branches
- **primitive** to demonstrate bad practice, very primitive way of doing these kind of application onCreate pollution.
- **mid-way** to demonstrate how basic dagger implementation can clean up the application's onCreate already.
- **plugins** to demonstrate how the proposed conceptual approach cleans up the application's onCreate.
- **buildtype** to demonstrate how to provide different plugins up to buildType.

## Disclaimer
These libraries are not selected in any specific reasons but just randomly to demonstrate how fast Application onCreate can grow.
